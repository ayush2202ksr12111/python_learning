# In python we have a feature of lists which will help insert number of lists in it

# we will define a variable that will define list of numbers to be added

# index    0    1   2   3
nums =   [25, 12, 36, 95]
# index   -4  -3  -2  -1 
 # suppose we want to display the whole numbers list array
 
print(nums)

#now suppose if we just want to print the single number at particular index this will print at index position 0 

print(nums[0])
