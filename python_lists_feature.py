# In python we have a feature of lists which will help insert number of lists in it

# we will define a variable that will define list of numbers to be added

# index    0    1   2   3
nums =   [25, 12, 36, 95]
# index   -4  -3  -2  -1 
 # suppose we want to display the whole numbers list array
 
print(nums)

#now suppose if we just want to print the single number at particular index this will print at index position 0 

print(nums[0])

# now suppose we want to print the number at index position 3

print(nums[3])

# now suppose we want to print the number list starting from index postion 1 till end

print(nums[1:])


#now suppose we want to print the number at index position -1 this will print the number from last position

print(nums[-1])

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# now we will use string feature here 

# we use names list that will contain multiple string variables


# index      0        1          2       3

names = [ 'naveen', 'Kiran' , 'John', 'Kailash' ]

# index     -4        -3        -2       -1 
 
# suppose we want to display the whole names list array
 
print(names)

#now suppose if we just want to print the single name at particular index this will print at index position 0 

print(names[0])



# now we want to print the number from first position by using the negative number for that we are going to use -4

print(nums[-4])
