# updating the values without adding the variables

# we have defiend a variable x
x = 9

#now we will add the value of x in it and make sure it is 19

result = x+10

print(result)

# now suppose we want to change the output we will define a variable and add the value in it

# now we will define a y variable

y=3

# now we are goint to use shortcut for adding the variable

print(result+y)
