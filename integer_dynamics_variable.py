# variables are container that will store your values

# we play the add game 

# we have defined an x variable

x=2
# we have added the 3 directly
print(x+3)

#_____________________________________________



# meanwhile we will define one more variable 

y=3

# now we will add the same variable here also

print(x+y)
#_____________________________________________


# now we will change the value as we know the value is not static it will be changed

x=9

#now we will adding one more variable also
print(x+y)
