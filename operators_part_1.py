# we are writing operators in python 
# we are declaring variable x as 2

x=2

# we are declaring variable y as 3

y=3

# now we are going to add the variable 


x = x+2

print(x)
# another way to adding a variable here shortcut way

x+=2
print(x)
# now we are going to multiply the variable

x=x*2
print(x)

# now we are going to multiply suing short cut method

x*=2
print(x)
