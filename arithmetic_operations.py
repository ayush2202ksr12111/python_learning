# we  will define two variable in python for arithmetic operations
# variable a
a = 10
# variable b
b = 4

# adding two variable in python meanwhile printing it

print(a+b)

# subtracting two variable in python meanwhile printing it

print(a-b)

# multiplying two variable meanwhile printing it

print(a*b)

# dividing two variable meanwhile printing it it also give floating value



print(a/b)

# dividing two variable meanwhile printing it it also give floating value for that we will use '//'

print(a//b)


# suppose i am doing an operation which could be 2 * 2 * 2

print(2 * 2 * 2)

# short method of doing the power of 2 * 2 * 2 which could be 2 ** 3

print(2 ** 3)
