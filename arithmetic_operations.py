# we  will define two variable in python for arithmetic operations
# variable a
a = 10
# variable b
b = 4

# adding two variable in python meanwhile printing it

print(a+b)

# subtracting two variable in python meanwhile printing it

print(a-b)

# multiplying two variable meanwhile printing it

print(a*b)

# dividing two variable meanwhile printing it it also give floating value

print(a/b)

# dividing two variable meanwhile printing it it also give floating value for that we will use '//'

print(a//b)
