# we are writing operators in python 
# we are declaring variable x as 2

x=2

# we are declaring variable y as 3

y=3

# now we are going to add the variable 


x = x+2

print(x)
# another way to adding a variable here shortcut way

x+=2
print(x)
# now we are going to multiply the variable

x=x*2
print(x)

# now we are going to multiply suing short cut method

x*=2
print(x)
#===========================================================

# urinary operator

# how can a variable easily becomes negative

# we will declare a variable with n as 7

n = 7
print(n)
#now we are going to convert it without converting it into value as negative

n = -n

print(n)
